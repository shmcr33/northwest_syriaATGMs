# Northwest Syria ATGMs
This work-in-progress web map shows the use various anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) by a number of opposition factions in northwest Syria from 2014 to 2022.  The data used for this project is from geolocated videos of missile launches with relevant information stripped for viewing in the map when clicking on points. A play button allows for users to see the use of ATGMs over time. A heat map is also added to see the intensity of strikes in certain areas of the northwest. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to map all Syrian Opposition ATGMs used in the northwest, with a specific focus on TOW ATGMs. 

On the legend, precision (precise, approximate, and general) is colored and indicates how accurate the geolocation is with precise being the exact spot where the ATGM impacted and general being the overall area where the launch happened such as town, village, neighborhood, etc. Additionally, the legend provides different shapes for the various types of ATGMs in the dataset. It is recommended that different areas of the map are zoomed in on to see more detailed locations of strikes. 

As of 2/10/2026, this map contains geolocated point data from the following Syrian Opposition Groups:

Central Division

First Coastal Division

Jaish al-Izza

Tajumma Suqour al-Ghab

Liwa Suqour al-Jabal

Harakat Hazzm

13th Division

101st Division

Liwa Fursan al-Haqq

Below are useful terms that have been abbreviated on the map: 

SAA = Syrian Arab Army

YPG = People's Defense Units

ISIS = Islamic State

Addtional data will be uploaded as the geolocation and validation of videos from different groups is completed. OpenStreetMaps, MapBox Topograhy, and MapBox Streets V-12 are currently the base layer.
